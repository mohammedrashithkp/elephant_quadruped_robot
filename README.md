# elephant_quadruped_robot
The quadruped robot which excels at traversing challenging terrains are often made for their speed.As a mammal which was used for carrying heavy objects from ancient times ,elephants are quite energy-efficient in traversing.This is due to walking pattern also known as gait pattern in academic literactures and its anatomy. Hence here we attempt to mimic the gait pattern to create a robotic quadruped to carry heavy loads conserving energy.
